    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 21, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>FilmNest ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how FilmNest, developed by Audi Padilangga / BRG Developer, handles information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>FilmNest does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.</strong></p>
    
    <p>All information you enter into FilmNest (including photos, roll details, camera information, film types, locations, and any other metadata) is stored locally on your device only. We have no access to this information.</p>

    <h2>Photo Library Access</h2>
    <p>FilmNest requests access to your device's photo library solely to allow you to import film scans into the app. This access is required for the app to function. The photos you select:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remain on your device only</li>
        <li>Are not uploaded to any server</li>
        <li>Are not transmitted to us or any third party</li>
        <li>Are organized locally within the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Location Information</h2>
    <p>FilmNest allows you to manually add location tags to your rolls. This information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is entered manually by you</li>
        <li>Does not use GPS or location tracking</li>
        <li>Is stored locally on your device only</li>

        <li>All data is encrypted and handled securely</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subscription Terms</h2>

        <li>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies</li>
        <li>We do not transfer data outside the EEA (because we don't collect data)</li>
        <li>RevenueCat handles purchase verification in compliance with GDPR</li>
    </ul>

        <li>RevenueCat processes only purchase verification data necessary for the service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since FilmNest does not collect any personal information beyond purchase verification, California privacy rights regarding data access, deletion, and sale/sharing do not apply to locally stored data.</p>
