    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 21, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>FilmNest ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how FilmNest, developed by Audi Padilangga / BRG Developer, handles information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>FilmNest does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.</strong></p>
    
    <p>All information you enter into FilmNest (including photos, roll details, camera information, film types, locations, and any other metadata) is stored locally on your device only. We have no access to this information.</p>

    <h2>Photo Library Access</h2>
    <p>FilmNest requests access to your device's photo library solely to allow you to import film scans into the app. This access is required for the app to function. The photos you select:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Are not uploaded to any server</li>
        <li>Are not transmitted to us or any third party</li>
        <li>Are organized locally within the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Location Information</h2>
    <p>FilmNest allows you to manually add location tags to your rolls. This information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is entered manually by you</li>
        <li>Does not use GPS or location tracking</li>
        <li>Is stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li>Is never transmitted to us or any third party</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Social media integrations</li>

        <li>We do not collect or have access to your payment information</li>
        <li>Your purchase status is stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>Apple may collect transaction information according to their privacy policy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data remains on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your data is protected by your device's security measures (passcode, biometric authentication, etc.)</li>
        <li>We cannot access, recover, or restore your data</li>
        <li>If you delete the app or lose your device, your data cannot be recovered by us</li>
        <li>Backing up your device (via iCloud or iTunes) will back up your FilmNest data as part of your device backup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>FilmNest does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. Since we do not collect any data at all, our app is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

    <h2>GDPR Compliance (European Users)</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect or process any personal data</li>
        <li>There is no data to request, access, rectify, erase, or port</li>
        <li>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies</li>
        <li>We do not transfer data outside the EEA (because we don't collect data)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CCPA/CPRA Compliance (California Users)</h2>
    <p>For users in California, USA:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not sell, share, or disclose personal information (because we don't collect it)</li>
        <li>We do not use your information for targeted advertising</li>
        <li>There is no personal information to request disclosure of or deletion of</li>
        <li>We do not discriminate against users who exercise privacy rights</li>
    </ul>
